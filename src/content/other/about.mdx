I'm a Technical Services Manager and Systems Engineer based in Melbourne, with 18+ years in IT infrastructure.

Currently leading deployment and infrastructure delivery at Megabus Software — building automated deployment pipelines, managing server migrations, and keeping 500+ endpoints running smoothly across Australia and overseas.

I'm passionate about automation, documentation, and building things that just work. When I'm not wrangling infrastructure, I'm tinkering with my homelab or exploring new tech.

**What I work with:** Windows Server, Active Directory, Microsoft 365, PowerShell, Docker, Linux, Cisco networking, and whatever else needs fixing.

**Certifications:** CCNA, Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering (Network Security)
