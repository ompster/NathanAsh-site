I'm a Technical Services Manager and Systems Engineer based in Melbourne, with 13+ years in IT infrastructure.

Currently leading deployment and infrastructure delivery at Megabus Software — building automated deployment pipelines, managing server migrations, and keeping 2,800+ endpoints running smoothly across Australia and New Zealand.

I'm passionate about automation, documentation, and building things that just work. When I'm not wrangling infrastructure, I'm tinkering with my homelab or exploring new tech.

**What I work with:** Datto RMM, Autotask, VS Code, Intune, Entra ID, PowerShell, Python, Docker, Nox, Claude Code, and whatever else needs fixing.

**Certifications:** CCNA, Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering (Network Security)
