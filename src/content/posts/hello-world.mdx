Welcome to my new site! 

After letting my old WordPress blog gather dust for way too long, I've rebuilt from scratch using [Astro](https://astro.build) and the [Spectre](https://github.com/louisescher/spectre) theme. Hosted on Cloudflare Pages, deployed automatically from GitHub.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Homelab adventures** — What I'm running, what broke, what I learned
- **Automation** — PowerShell scripts, deployment pipelines, things that save time
- **Infrastructure** — Server migrations, networking, the occasional war story
- **Learning** — Currently diving deeper into Azure and Entra ID

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around.
