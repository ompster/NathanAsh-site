A collection of PowerShell scripts and tools I've built for:

- **Zero-touch SOE deployment** — Fully automated PC provisioning from bare metal
- **Windows 11 upgrade automation** — Pre-checks, OOH scheduling, post-validation
- **Device decommissioning** — Automated cleanup and data wiping
- **Endpoint health monitoring** — Scheduled checks and reporting

Built to eliminate repetitive manual work and ensure consistency across hundreds of endpoints.
